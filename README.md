I've created a comprehensive AI sentiment analysis system with a beautiful, production-ready interface. The system analyzes text sentiment in real-time using a lexicon-based approach with predefined word lists for positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

The application features a modern gradient background, intuitive card-based layout, and provides detailed sentiment breakdowns with confidence scores. Users can track their analysis history, export results, and see word-level sentiment highlighting. The responsive design ensures it works perfectly across all devices with smooth animations and professional styling throughout.

Core Features:

1) Real-time sentiment analysis as you type
2) Visual sentiment indicators with color-coded results
3) Confidence scoring and detailed breakdown
4) Word-level sentiment highlighting
5) Historical analysis tracking
6) Responsive design for all devices
7) Export results functionality

Design Elements:

1) Modern gradient backgrounds with smooth transitions
2) Card-based layout with subtle shadows and rounded corners
3) Color-coded sentiment visualization (green for positive, red for negative, yellow for neutral)
4) Smooth animations and micro-interactions
5) Typography hierarchy with proper contrast ratios
6) Interactive charts showing sentiment distribution
7) Hover effects and loading states
